SEAD is activity that neutralizes, destroys, or temporarily degrades surface-based enemy Air Defences by destructive or disruptive means. SEAD must be an integral part of all planning and air operations, but the SEAD requirement will vary according to mission objectives, system capabilities, and threat complexity.

Traditionally, there are three categories of SEAD, each of which reduces attrition and creates more favourable conditions for friendly air operations: 

* Area Of Responsibility (AOR)-/Joint Operation Area (JOA)-wide joint AD system suppression
* Localized suppression,
* Opportune suppression.

For each category, there are two means of executing SEAD, destructive and disruptive.
(1) Destructive Means. Destructive means seek the destruction of the target system or operating personnel.
(2) Disruptive Means. Disruptive means temporarily deny, degrade, deceive, delay, or neutralize enemy surface AD systems. Disruptive means may be either active or passive.

SEAD assets are often used in conjunction with other air operations/missions (i.e., air interdiction, OCA attack, airborne operations) when surface ADs are a factor. Specially trained aircrew and specially equipped aircraft are designed for SEAD missions, especially against an IADS. SEAD dedicated aircraft normally are equipped with special electronic detection and electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment, deceptive expendables (chaff, flares, or decoys), and antiradiation missiles (ARMs) for use against emitting radars.

During major operations, SEAD assets normally are too valuable to be used for missions without a SEAD requirement. Other fighter-attack and multi-role fighter crews normally are trained to support the SEAD mission, especially against the enemy AD infrastructure.
AD threats can encompass many systems normally integrated into an Integrated Air Defense System (IADS). Potential adversaries’ IADSs can differ widely from country to country in terms of organization, sophistication, and operational procedures. An adversary’s IADS needs to be analyzed in-depth with an eye to potential strengths and weaknesses, especially seams in coverage. The goal is to identify command structure, AD doctrine, early warning and tracking capabilities, C2 reliability/redundancy, and defensive weapons systems. SEAD operations target the following components of an IADS:
(1) IADS C2 nodes/centers.
(2) SAM sites.
(3) AAA.
(4) Early warning and fire control radars and GCI sites.
(5) SAM carriers and storage bunkers.
(6) AD operations and maintenance personnel.

SEAD Localized suppression operations normally are confined to geographic areas associated with specific targets or transit routes for a specific time. Under localized suppression, SEAD aircraft normally escort other aircraft to protect them from a surface-based air defense threat in that sector. Localized suppression normally takes place in different areas and times throughout the AOR/JOA. Planned to protect specific operations or missions.
