#### 1 GENERAL GUIDANCE
This guide outlines the procedures and responsibilities for aircrew operating the DCS F/A-18C Hornet in the con- text of flights organised and operated by the 132nd Virtual Wing. It is not however a substitute for good judge- ment. Deviations from and additions to these procedures should, at the judgement of the flight lead, be used if they positively affect the safe and effective prosecution of the mission and mission’s success.

---

### 2 MISSION PLANNING
#### 2.1 Responsibilities

2.1.1. The responsibility for mission planning for a particular flight is belongs to the flight lead but the duties should be shared by all flight members.  

2.1.2. It is the responsibility of each pilot to check all mission parameters to ensure no calculation mistakes or errors in judgement have been made in the mission plan. Items to consider include but are not limited to fuel re- quirements, take-off and landing data, map-and-route preparation, and communications regimes.  

2.2 Mission Prerequisites and Objectives  

2.2.1. Mission objectives should be well defined and well understood by all members of the flight. Each flight might contain multiple objectives covering training, currency, and mission specific needs.  

2.2.2. Mission prerequisites include skills and capabilities required in order to fulfil the mission. The mission can- not be undertaken unless all these pre-requisites are met, and should one change status to unmet for any reason the mission must be aborted and this information communicated to the mission commander at the earliest possible opportunity to re-planning and re-tasking.  

2.2.3. Training objectives include detailed expected outcomes about what is being trained. This should be clear and precise. Vagueness will only lead to ineffective training outcomes and wasted time.  

2.2.4. Currency objectives aim to ensure each pilot remains current on certain skills. Some skills to keep current include:
  - Day recovery
  - Low visibility recovery
  - Precision approach radar recovery
  - Night recovery
  - ILS recovery
  - Carrier case 1, 2, or 3 recovery
  - Airfield go-around procedures
  - Carrier go-around procedures
  - Airborne refuelling
  - Non-INS navigation (Tacan / VOR / VFR)
  - BFM defensive manoeuvring
  - BFM offensive manoeuvring
  - BVR defensive manoeuvring
  - BVR offensive manoeuvring


#### 2.3 Material
2.3.1. The following should be prepared and reviewed before any flight:

1. Mission data card (MDC). Where possible make the data card DCS Kneeboard compatible to accomodate pilots using Virtual Reality headsets. The contents make up a minimal subset of the e-brief and flight bag. At a minimum this should include:
  - GO / NO-GO criteria
– Weather restrictions
– AO status
– Minimum number of mission capable aircraft / pilots
  - The Flight Contract
  - Relevant weight/stores/weather related speeds
  - Local area map. By flight member agreement this may be the DCS F10 map.
  - Enroute charts.
  - Standardised F/A-18C Hornet checklist. The flight lead should ensure that each pilot has the most cur- rent and up-to-date version of the standardised annotated checklist. Abbreviated checklists are the re- sponsibility of each individual pilot.
  - Radio frequency and channel cards.
  - Coded authentication cards.
  - Appropriate airfield diagrams.
  - Appropriate weapon checklists.
  - AO status and known threat information.
  - Emergency checklists.
  - Minimum safe altitude for all traversed areas must be briefed for each phase of flight.
For a detailed breakdown of the briefing items see section **3, p. 4. (FIX)**

#### 2.4 Fuel Conservation

2.4.1. Fuel is the aircraft’s only sustained energy source and the fuel tanks represent the total stored energy for an aircraft during flight.

2.4.2. Pilots must consider fuel a limited and valuable commodity. This ensures that when a fight occurs you have the maximum volume of stored energy available with which to fight adversaries or defend against threats.

2.4.3. Procedures should be followed to ensure optimal fuel use throughout all phases of execution including:
  - ground operations;
  - flight planning;
  - power settings;
  - and climb-and-descent profiles.
2.5 Normal Flight Regimes
2.5.1. All pilots must strive to maintain proper controlled basic flight. This means that, at all times, the pilot is performing their regular instrument scan and deliberately in control of their
  - airspeed;
  - attitude;
  - altitude.

2.5.2. An awareness of the primary flight numbers is mandatory at all times. Even a momentary lapse can lead to stores damage or an unrecoverable emergency. In combat loss of energy awareness can become fatal very quickly.

2.5.3. Pilots will therefore develop and maintain the habit of initiating an instrument scan every five to ten sec- onds regardless of any other task they might be performing to ensure a constant awareness of their primary flight numbers.

2.5.4. Pilots will ensure that they know and follow the flight contract as briefed.

#### 2.6 Flight Cross Country, Over Water, or into Hostile Territory

2.6.1. Flights performed cross-country, over water, or into hostile territory should be accomplished with a min- imum of two aircraft. Shorter flights inside controlled and friendly airspace may be performed solo. Examples of solo operations may include a FAC(A) trainer proceeding from the airfield to a training range in anticipation of in- coming CAS training flights.

#### 2.7 Briefing
2.7.1. All flight members must attend a pre-flight briefing and post-flight debrief. These should usually be con- ducted immediately prior to and immediately after the flight unless previously arranged and agreed between flight members and where appropriate the operational functions of the wing.

2.7.2. Flight leads are responsible for sharing a clear briefing that promotes a safe and effective mission.

2.7.3. Flight leads are encouraged to share briefing responsibilities with wingmen. For example the detailed threat
discovery, assessment and briefing may be delegated to a wingman.

2.7.4. Flight briefings should allow for and accommodate the individual capabilities of each pilot in the flight.

2.7.5. Adequate time must be planned and set aside to allow a full and thorough briefing. No portion of the
briefing should be rushed. All items that are known to and understood by the flight members as operational stan- dards may be referred to simply as “standard”.

2.7.6. Items within the brief may be shared in any order provided clarity isn’t obscured.

2.7.7. If appropriate the flight may have an alternate mission available should be primary mission become impos-
sible to prosecute. In this case all factors of the alternate mission should be prepared and briefed exactly as the primary mission, though elements that don’t vary from the primary mission such as take-off and recover procedures need not be covered again.

#### 2.8 Debriefing

2.8.1. Flight leads must ensure that the mission is thoroughly debriefed to ensure the maximum possibility for learning.

2.8.2. Debriefs should take place immediately after the mission while its events are still clear in each pilot’s mind.

2.8.3. Use of debriefing tools such as TacView are strongly encouraged.

2.8.4. When debriefing it’s preferred that pilots be referred to simply by their flight number to minimised person-
alisation. The intent is not to point fingers but rather for each member to learn from the experience of all other members.

There is a flight administrative section which covers details appropriate to every flight and sections that are more specific to individual missions.

3.1.2. Some of these items will be as per SOP and can be briefed as such to save time. It’s up to the flight lead to decide what to include in the written briefing pack but remember, if it’s not written down before the mission you can’t expect a busy and potentially stressed pilot to recall it during the mission.

  - Enemy fighters
  - Weapons available to the enemy fighters including known:
(a) range
(b) accuracy
(c) tactics to defend against the weapon
  - Enemy airborne detection and control systems like AWACs etc
  - Airborne traffic that may pose a collision risk like friendly or enemy helicopters, drone, or strike aircraft operating in the AO.

#### 3.6 Air-to-air: Combat Air Patrol Mission
3.6.1. Combat air patrols typically serve a barrier function. The intent is to prevent enemy air assets from entering an area or defined zone around that area for some period of time. For example the requirement might be to keep enemy aircraft at a distance long enough for dedicated friendly strike aircraft to leave the area, or for dedi- cated sweep aircraft to commit on and prosecute the trespassers. Although the situation is always considered to be dynamic it is not the aim of a CAP flight to prosecute and destroy enemy aircraft unless those aircraft persist in trying to enter the area or specifically target the CAP flight.

3.6.2. With the above in mind the briefing must very clearly defined, and each pilot internalise, the rules of engagement for any specific CAP mission.

3.6.3. The purpose of the patrol should be well defined. For example it may be to keep enemy air from entering the area or getting to within weapon deployment range of a high value asset.

3.6.4. The briefing should impart a thorough understanding of the asset or area being patrolled and all relevant details regarding these. For example, the mission might be a HAVCAP and require protecting a tanker. Details like what speed the tanker can retreat at, where it will retreat to, and at what range enemy air assets can deploy weapons on the tanker are all vital when deciding on the final rules of engagement to take into the cockpit.

3.6.5. As an extension of the previous point the minimum expectations of any barrier action must be well defined. For example, enemy fast jets must be kept away for at least four minutes to allow slower moving aircraft like A-10s to escape to safe or well defended territory.

3.6.6. Mission specific criteria based on tactics and threat assessment for the engagement phase might include:
  - Rules of Engagement
  - Airspeeds, altitudes, and turns while BVR 3. BVR geometry
  - Press / abort criteria
  - Minimum ranges for:
(a) identification (b) sorting
(c) shooting
(d) turning out

3.6.7. Considerations for the egress or separation phase:
  - Disengagement plan
  - Minimum fuel levels
  - Minimum weapon state levels
  - Egress rejoin, formation, and responsibilities

3.6.8. Considerations for contingencies should include:
  - Short range or late commits
  - Loss of mutual support
  - Safe escape and rendezvous points

#### 3.7 Air-to-air: Sweep
3.7.1. Mission specific criteria based on tactics and threat assessment for the engagement phase might include:

### 4 NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES
#### 4.1 Standard Contract
4.1.1. The standard contract unless briefed otherwise is
  - Climb: for rejoin 300 KIAS at 95% RPM. The reduced RPM provides the wingman with the excess energy required to intercept the lead aircraft.
  - Formation: fingertip with #2 left
  - Cruise: 350 KIAS, 30° or 45° turns when in formation
  - Air combat readiness: 450 KIAS defensive combat spread, 1000’ vertical separation, energy sustaining turns
  - A-A radar mode: #1 scan high and far, #2 scan low and near
  - When in formation lead should restrict MIL power to 97% RPM even in climbs, and maintain a similar margin above idle. This is to ensure that the wingman has enough excess power available to maintain proper formation positioning.

#### 4.2 Pre-Flight Signals
4.2.1. Navigation lights should be turned ON prior to engine start.

4.2.2. The taxi lights should be turned ON only after taxi clearance has been received.

4.2.3. Anti-collision lights should be turned ON when the aircraft is cleared to enter the runway.

4.2.4. After landing and vacating the runway the Anti-Collision beacon should be turned OFF. Check taxi lights are on.

#### 4.3 Communications
4.3.1. Communications with agencies should be performed on the number 2 auxiliary radio under normal circumstances.

4.3.2. Communications between flight members should be performed on the number 1 radio under normal circumstances.

4.3.3. Intraflight communications must be established between the flight lead and all flight members on the prebriefed channel or frequency before engine start.

4.3.4. Pilots should always respond to Flight Lead in numerical flight order. This allows the flight lead to notice a non-responsive member.

4.3.5. Once the jet is fully started, all systems are setup and checked, and the INS system aligned, each flight member must report in with the call “ready to taxi”.

4.3.6. Prior to taxi the flight lead will perform an Alpha Check with his flight to ensure all all aircraft have correct INS positional alignment and that all waypoints are correctly programmed.

#### 4.4 Takeoff Restrictions & Responsibilities
4.4.1. Taxi Interval/Speed. Minimum taxi interval is 50m (≈ 150 feet) staggered or 100m (≈ 300 feet) in trail. This spacing may be reduced when holding short of entering the runway. Speed should be limited to 25 knots and 10 knots in turns.

4.4.2. Before taxi can commence each flight member must be aware of the location of all the aircraft in the flight. Taxi starts when the last wingman responds to the taxi directive.

#### 4.4 Takeoff Restrictions & Responsibilities 4 NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES
4.4.3. Flight Lineup: The lead pilot must consider runway length, width, condition, load-out, and weather when selecting the flight line-up. Line-up should be selected in briefing but must be be briefed no later than before start- ing to taxi.

4.4.4. In good weather with at least 5nm visibility up to four aircraft can line-up for take-off at no less than 3 second spacing assuming the runway is wide enough to allow for safe operations [[ Consult with the 176th ]].
Take-off: The pilot will:
  - not take-off with a 90°cross-wind component greater than 30 kts;
  - not perform a section take-off with a 90°cross-wind component greater than 15 kts;
  - respect a minimum spacing of 5 seconds when carrying heavy air-to-ground ordnance;
  - respect a minimum spacing of 10 seconds when in IMC conditions (see section 5, p. 24);
  - restrict formation takeoffs to two aircraft at a time;
  - not perform a formation take-off when carrying live munitions other than air-to-air missiles and gun ammunition;
  - perform a field take-off with weight exceeding 51,900 lbs
  - perform a carrier take-off with weight exceeding 51,900 lbs

4.4.5. Afterburner take-off is mandatory when on a short runway or carrying heavy air-to-ground ordnance.

4.4.6. The takeoff procedure is:
  - Lead calls “run’em up” to spool engines to 80% brakes on.
  - Each flight member including lead should in order:
(a) check all instruments and warning lights indicate correct systems operation; (b) if all criteria are met then respond with “green”.
  - When the last flight member responds lead can release his brakes, apply takeoff power and start the takeoff roll.
  - When the last flight member has taken off, raised the landing gear, and visually acquired the aircraft ahead of him then he should confirm these three things with the call “Airborne, gear up, visual”. This indicates to the lead pilot that all aircraft are airborne and proceeding to initial rejoin.

4.4.7. Rejoin: Lead should not exceed the contract climb and power restrictions until join up. Wing pilots may exceed airspace airspeed restrictions after take-off until saddled provided they join-up immediately after take-off. Civilian airspeed restrictions may be waived by agreement with local controlling authorities.

4.4.8. Check NOTAMS and local airfield and controller regulations before take-off.

4.4.9. Rejoin should always be at a pre-determined contract speed and the lead pilot must exercise strict speed and power discipline during this phase.

### 4.5 Formation Flight
4.5.1. Proper positioning for close formation flight when at parade spacing is for the wingman’s head to be in- line with the leading edge of the main wing of the lead aircraft and slightly below. Wingtip to wingtip spacing of between 3 and 5 feet (±1 - 1.5m). When transitioning to route spacing maintain the same aspect but extend the range to 500’.

4.5.2. Proper positioning for cruise formation is for the wingman to manoeuvre freely within a 70° cone behind the lead aircraft with a tail to nose separation in the direction of flight of about 10 feet (±3m). Note that in practice you should stay on one of the side edges to remain visible to your flight lead and switch sides as needed to ensure efficient formation flight as the lead pilot manoeuvres. The element lead uses the same cone as the dash-2 but at a spacing 10 feet behind the dash-2 and is also free to switch sides at will to maintain efficient manoeu- vring. The dash-4 flies similarly but off the dash-3.

4.5.3. The flight lead is always responsible for flight actions. Wingmen must be prepared to assume the lead role when directed.

4.5.4. Remember: the lead role is always given, never taken.

4.5.5. In order to hand over lead responsibility the pilot relinquishing the role calls “X, you are lead”, then the
pilot taking over confirms report “X is lead”. The pilot relinquishing lead must then respond again with “X, you are lead”.

4.5.6. The minimum altitude when changing lead is 500 feet over land or 1000 feet over water. Lead change must be initiated from a stabilised and wings level attitude in a stable formation when visibility limitations are present. When in formation the lead should not initiate lead changes with wingmen further back than normal fingertip or route positioning, or 30° back from line abreast. Both pilots must have clear visibility of each other.

4.5.7. Flight leads must not break flights up from visual formations until each pilot has a fix from which to navi- gate whether visual, radar, INS or radio navigation.

4.5.8. Under normal situations in both en-route formations and tactical formations the wingman is primarily re- sponsible for flight path deconfliction. However the flight lead becomes primarily responsible when the flight path places the flight lead well aft of the wingman’s 3/9 line or the flight lead forces the wingman’s attention away from the flight lead.

4.5.9. When one pilot goes “heads down” the other pilot is immediately responsible for deconfliction until the former calls “heads up” again.

4.5.10. Loss of Visual or “Blind” Procedures: Flight members will call “blind” with their altitude in thou- sands of feet, e.g. “X, blind angels 15.2”. A visual flight member will call “visual” and initiate a talk-on to achieve deconfliction and allow the blind pilot to visually re-acquire the flight. If both flight members are blind they will both call “blind” with an altitude and the flight lead will give immediate directives to ensure immediate safe verti- cal deconfliction first, and only then direct to attempt re-acquisition. If there is no acknowledgement of the “blind” call then the flight member will manoeuvre away from the last known position of the other member.

4.5.11. Low altitude operations: Minimum airspeed and altitude for low altitude operations is 300 KIAS and 1000 feet AGL except where performing pre-briefed NOE training or operations. At night and in low visibility con- ditions all pilots will comply with the MSA (minimum safe altitude) as per airport and navigation charts. If a pilot experiences task saturation or confusion, or a knock-it-off call is made, the pilot will immediately climb to the MSA. When in low altitude conditions, if a known terrain obstacle cannot be visually acquired the lead pilot must command an immediate climb to MSA no later than 3 nm prior to reaching the obstacle.

4.5.12. Minimum Altitude Display: When conducting low altitude procedures pilots must ensure that the minimum safe altitude is set as required so as to show correctly on the minimum altitude display in the HUD. Pilots should also ensure that warning sounds are turned on.

4.5.13. Lost Wingman Recovery: In case one or more aircraft loses sight of the formation and is unable to find the flight again the flight briefing should include reset positions and altitudes that the wing can fly to and hold
at to facilitate a rejoin. In case this isn’t possible for some reason such as wingman task saturation, confusion, or equipment failure a VFR route back from each waypoint should also be included in the flight briefing.

#### 4.6 En Route Formations
4.6.1. When in close formation the wingman should remain with his eye’s fixed on the flight lead’s aircraft or “padlocked”. The flight lead should not give any directives that require the wingman to go heads-down while in close formation. If such activity is required then the flight lead should first kick his wingman out to a wider route formation and ensure that stable level flight has been established.

4.6.2. A flight lead should not perform any changes in attitude, altitude or airspeed while his wingman is heads- down. A wingman must be considered heads-down immediately after a directive involving work in the cockpit is given. For example, of you call for a fence check, once the last wingman has acknowledge the directive they are considered heads-down until the last wingman reports back with the fence check complete. At no point during this phase should the flight lead allow his aircraft’s attitude, altitude or airspeed to change. If safe it’s recommended that an autopilot mode be engaged before initiating such an action.

![Formations Shown with Route Spacing](/images/ROUTEFORM.PNG)

**Formations Shown with Route Spacing**

4.6.3. Cross under: When the lead needs to change the side his wingman is flying he will call for him to “cross under”. When in parade formation he should then maintain stable straight and level flight until the wingman has completed the manoeuvre.

4.6.4. The cross-under manoeuvre is performed by the wingman retarding his throttle slightly and dipping the nose to gain altitude separation. Next he slides sideways under the lead aircraft to reach the same position on the opposite side. Lastly the wingman moves forward and up back into parade position off the lead’s wing.

#### 4.7 Tactical Formations
4.7.1. Tactical formations are formations where the lead and wingman are separated by 0.5 nm or more. 1nm is the most common distance when in a defensive posture. 1.5nm is most common distance in an offensive posture. Note that due to visibility limitations in DCS it may be preferable to maintain no more than 1nm unless the lead and wingman have a good proficiency when flying together. The separation and positioning allows for many things in aerial combat, for example safe simultaneous weapon deployment.

4.7.2. When transitioning from a route or close formation to a tactical formation it can be helpful to employ the 20-20 rule: Increase your speed by 20 knots, and offset your direction away from your lead by 20°. At 0.2 nm from your final position slow to your contract speed and turn back to your cruise heading. At speeds betwee 300 and 400 knots this should result in you being very close to the correct line-abreast position once at the correct distance. If you are to be positioned diagonally to the rear of your lead do the same as above except don’t alter your airspeed.

![Line abreast](/images/LINEABREAST.PNG)

**Line abreast**

4.7.3. When flying line-abreast wingmen must strive for a 0° line unless otherwise required by the flight lead. Maintaining 1 NM horizontal and 500 to 1000 feet vertical separation provides optimal mutual support in terms of visual reference and firepower from both the beam and 6-o’clock positions. This is known as the “defensive combat spread”. An “offensive combat spread” increases separation to 1.5 NM and the supporting fighters energy ad- vantage to between 1500 and 3000 feet.

4.7.4. The wingman should stack above the lead. All horizontal manoeuvring should happen on this plane above the lead aircraft guaranteeing constant deconfliction.

4.7.5. In lower visibility wingmen may be instructed to fly at 0.5 NM separation to maintain proper visibility.

4.7.6. This formation ensures that each pilot is in position to detect an enemy attacking their wingman from behind. On seeing such an adversary the wingman should immediately call for a cross-turn break and bring maximum firepower to bear on the incoming opponent. Note that where all-aspect missiles are employed by the enemy this may not be possible.

![The Four Ship Offset Box Formation](/images/BOXFORM.PNG)

**The Four Ship Offset Box Formation**

4.7.7. This formation comprises two elements each in line abreast formation and 1 to 2 NM apart. This allows the trailing element to immediately converge on an enemy making a rear intercept on the lead aircraft. It also po- sitions the flight so that it’s setup to immediately initiate a grinder tactic on enemy flights coming from ahead of the formation.

4.7.8. The box formation allows an easy transition to a CAP setup if the element simply falls back to 10nm, or an offensive grinder setup if the element falls back to 5nm.

![Spread Four Tactical Formation](/images/SPREADFOUR.PNG)

**Spread Four Tactical Formation**


4.7.9. Spread Four is similar to the line abreast formation but with slightly more manoeuvring latitude. The dash- 3 flies off the dash-1 and 2 and 4 fly of their respective element leads. In daytime wingmen should strive to main- tain the 0° line at all times. The distances involved in Spread Four make visual acquisition of the whole flight at once difficult and maximise BVR weapon employment capability.

![Fluid Four Tactical Formation](/images/FLUIDFOUR.PNG)

**Fluid Four Tactical Formation**

4.7.10. Fluid Four has the element leads in line abreast with their wingmen in either a wedge or fighting wing position. This is a good concentration of force formation for relatively inexperienced wingmen and night vision as- sisted flights. Note that defensive manoeuvring can cause deconfliction problems and should be covered in detail in the briefing to ensure effective use in combat.


#### 4.8 Tactical Turns
4.8.1. Both aircraft will perform the turn by performing an energy sustaining turn.

4.8.2. After the turn is complete the throttle is returned to it’s position before the turn commenced. The airspeed and altitude before, during, and after the turn must remain constant. The following procedure is required:
An energy sustaining turn is a level turn conducted at full military power using “G” to maintain airspeed.
  - set your throttle to FULL MIL, then;
  - bank and pull to maintain a level turn at exactly the contract speed (for example 350 knots), then;
  - at your new heading roll out back to level, then;
  - return the throttle to the position it was before the turn and ensure you are still at your briefed speed.

4.8.3. In the F/A-18C Hornet it’s recommended to use a fuel flow value as the indication of current engine power. 90° tactical turns:

![90° Tactical turn](/images/TAC90.PNG)

**90° Tactical turn**

4.8.4. A 90° tactical turn while in line abreast formation will be directed with the call “TAC Left / Right” or “TAC Left / Right heading”.

4.8.5. The turn will start immediately when the last pilot responds with their flight number. See section 4.14, p. 22.

4.8.6. The pilot that is turning into their wingman initiates the turn by turning first

4.8.7. When turning away from the wingman the pilot will watch the other airframe begin it’s turn and then ini-
tiate their own turn when the other airframe’s nose is pointing directly at them.

4.8.8. Both aircraft will complete the turn by performing an energy sustained turn

![45° Tactical turn](/images/TAC45.PNG)

**45° Tactical turn**

4.8.9. A 45° tactical turn while in line abreast formation will be directed with the call “TAC Left / Right 45” or
“TAC Left / Right heading”.

4.8.10. The turn will start immediately when the last pilot responds with their flight number. See section 4.14,
p. 22.

4.8.11. The pilot that is turning into their wingman initiates the turn by turning first

4.8.12. When turning away from the wingman the pilot will watch the other airframe begin it’s turn and then
initiate their own turn when the other airframe passes their 6-o’clock position.

4.8.13. Both aircraft will perform the turn by performing an energy sustained turn

![30° check turns](/images/CHECKTURN.PNG)

**30° check turns**

4.8.14. A 30° check turn while in line abreast formation will be directed with the call “Check Left / Right” or
“Check Left / Right heading”.

4.8.15. The turn will start immediately when the last pilot responds with their flight number. See section 4.14,
p. 22.

4.8.16. Both aircraft initiate the turn simultaneously to maintain a 30° bank.

4.8.17. The inside aircraft turns an additional 30° then turns back to re-establish the 1 NM spacing. This snaking
manoeuvre prevents the inside pilot from moving ahead and breaking the line-abreast formation.

4.8.18. The throttle must be used to ensure airspeed remains constant throughout the manoeuvre.

![Hook turns](/images/HOOKTURN.PNG)

**Hook turns**

4.8.19. A hook turn allows the flight to reverse their direction while maintaining their tactical formation and offset to the right or left in the process.

4.8.20. The turn will start immediately when the last pilot responds with their flight number. See section **4.14, p. 22. (FIX)**

4.8.21. Both aircraft initiate a simultaneously level energy sustained turn which continues until the airframe is pointing in the reciprocal direction.

4.8.22. The pitch back is related to the energy sustaining turn except that it uses a nose high attitude in the turn to gain altitude while turning.

4.8.23. When performing a pitch back energy is either lost or spent more slowly meaning the turning circle will be wider or airspeed will be lower after the manoeuvre. This will require the wingman to perform some extra work returning to position.

4.8.24. The lead pilot should cover how this manoeuvre is expected to be performed during the pre-flight briefing.
Slice Back:

4.8.25. The slice back is related to the energy sustaining turn except that it uses a nose low attitude in the turn to trade altitude for airspeed while turning and is usually done defensively when airspeed is critical.

4.8.26. When performing a slice back altitude is converted to airspeed and the turning circle will be affected by the manoeuvre. This will require the wingman to perform some extra work returning to position.

4.8.27. The lead pilot should cover how this manoeuvre is expected to be performed during the pre-flight briefing.

![Cross Turn](/images/CROSSTURN.PNG)

**Cross Turn**

4.8.28. A cross turn allows the flight to reverse their direction while maintaining their tactical formation.

4.8.29. The turn will start immediately when the last pilot responds with their flight number. **See section 4.14, p. 22.(FIX)**

4.8.30. Both aircraft initiate a simultaneous level energy sustained turn which continues until the airframe is pointing in the reciprocal direction.

4.8.31. Note that because this turn typically starts 1 nm apart the aircraft are turning into each other. As the radius of a 180° energy sustaining turn has a much larger radius the aircraft will be substantially further than 1nm apart after the turn. Therefore both aircraft should continue the turn for an additional 30°, and then turn back to the desired heading once their separation gets to 1.4nm to settle on the final heading at 1nm.

![Shackle](/images/SHACKLE.PNG)

**Shackle**

4.8.32. A shackle manoeuvre is used to switch sides. It can also be a quick way to get two aircraft no longer
abreast back into position.

4.8.33. The turn will start immediately when the last pilot responds with their flight number. **See section 4.14, p. 22.**

4.8.34. The two aircraft initiate an equivalent but opposite level turn into each other.

4.8.35. Once the wingman passes over the lead pilot the two aircraft start to turn back toward the original head-
ing so as to end up with the correct tactical spacing between the two aircraft.


#### 4.9 Air Refuelling

![AAR](/images/AAR.PNG)

4.9.1. When in close formation with the tanker the closure rate must not exceed 2 kts.

4.9.2. off the left wing of the tanker.
The initial position prior to in-air refuelling has the lead pilot at pre-contact and remaining pilots in order

4.9.3. If there are two hoses then the lead pilot takes the left hose and the next takes the right hose. Note that this order is because the tanker in DCS releases the left hose first, then the right hose, then finally the centre hose.

4.9.4. If all pilots have a high enough proficiency then a third aircraft may use the centre hose if available, however if there is any doubt about the flight safety then consider the third hose restricted.

4.9.5. After refuelling the pilot should form up on the tanker’s right wing in order. Note that only one aircraft may change position at any one time. This reduces the risk of in-air collisions.

4.9.6. The order of aircraft on the tanker’s right wing after refuelling may be reversed by lead if the situation justifies, for example if the flight will peel off right immediately after.


#### 4.10 Recovery and Landing at an Airfield
4.10.1. The maximum permitted crosswind with a flared landing is 30kts.

4.10.2. The maximum permitted crosswind with a single element formation landing is 15kts.

4.10.3. Overhead break landings must not be performed across another active runway unless directed to do so by ATC. Always break away from the second active runway.

4.10.4. Overhead break landings should not be performed over populated ground where possible unless directed to do so by ATC. If you have building on one side and fields on the other break over the fields.

4.10.5. The controlling authority (usually the tower) specifying a break direction always overrides the two restric- tions above.

4.10.6. For VFR straight in approaches pilots must check and call gear down no later than 3NM on final. 

4.10.7. Gear and flaps must not be deployed at speeds exceeding 240KIAS.

4.10.8. For an IFR approach pilots must call gear down at a pre-determined approach fix or published glide-slope intercept point.

4.10.9. For an overhead break landing check and call gear down just prior to entering the base leg.

4.10.10. AOA: The normal angle of attack for landing at all permitted weight configurations is 8.1°.

4.10.11. Note that the airbrake should no longer be used once established on the glide slope.

4.10.12. Due to the centre of gravity relative to the undercarriage aero-braking should not be performed in the F/A-18C Hornet during rollout after landing.

4.10.13. When a whole flight lands in quick succession, the lead pilot will always take the hot lane which is the lane on the same side that the flight will leave the runway. Subsequent aircraft will stagger their landings on alter- nate sides of the runway.

4.10.14. Minimum spacing between sequentially landing aircraft is 3000 feet (0.5nm), or 6000 feet (1nm) with high wind or turbulence.

4.10.15. Formation approaches are only allowed if the aircraft are symmetrically loaded with A-A ordnance or are carrying no stores.

4.10.16. Formation approaches are not allowed if:
  - there is a cross-wind component exceeding 15kts;
  - the runway is wet or slippery;
  - the runway width is < 125 feet;
  - the weather has a ceiling lower than 500 feet AGL.

#### 4.11 Performing an Overhead Brake at the Carrier

![CASE1](/images/CASE1.PNG)

**CASE 1**

4.11.1. Set the radar altimeter to 370 feet.

4.11.2. The break position is slightly offset from the carrier on the outside of the pattern just far enough so that you can clearly see the carrier deck and check that it is clear of obstructions that will prevent a safe landing. 

4.11.3. Aircraft should approach the break position at 800 feet, 350KIAS, and in echelon formation with wingmen spread away from the direction of the break.

4.11.4. Ideally a flight lead begins the break when shortly after being abeam the carrier but may delay 1NM - 1.5NM for safety reasons.

4.11.5. The maximum delay for the break for any member of the flight is 4NM.

4.11.6. Subsequent aircraft in the flight or element should break 10 seconds after the aircraft ahead.

4.11.7. To perform the brake manoeuvre extend the speed brake and pull to hold a approximately 10% of your airspeed in G in a level turn to reverse direction. Aim to reach 250KIAS about midway through the turn.

4.11.8. Level out downwind between 1.1NM and 1.3NM from the carrier and descend to 600 feet while extending the gear, flaps, and settling to an on-speed AoA of 8.1°.

4.11.9. Start the approach turn when you see the white of the round-down, or just past the stern of the ship. The HSI indicated the correct position when the heading to the TACAN station is 5° behind your own aircraft’s beam.

4.11.10. Perform the base turn at 30° bank, ± − 300 to −400FPM vertical speed. At 90° aim for 500 feet altitude and increase vertical velocity to -400 to -450 FPM. Aim to cross the wake of the ship at 370 feet (radar al- timeter for confirmation).

4.11.11. As soon as you roll out transfer your attention to the ball and fly the ball all the way down to the deck using power and not pitch to correct altitude deviations.

4.11.12. When calling the ball to the LSO the format is, side number, aircraft type, ball, fuel state, e.g.


#### 4.12 CASE I Carrier Landing Procedure (Visual Flight Rules)

  - Set the TACAN and TACAN course line for the carrier.
  - Ensure you receive altimeter pressure from ATC.
  - Enter a 2,000ft, 250KIAS, 5 nm diameter left hand orbit over the boat with barometric altitude hold. Separation between stacked formations is 1000 feet.
  - Configure:
– Hook down
– Displays to Engine Page, HSI, and HUD repeater – Anti-Skid OFF
– Hook Bypass to Carrier
– Radio altimeter warning to 370ft.
  - When abeam and behind the boat turn to approach the carrier from the starboard side descending to 800 ft at 350 KIAS.
  - Perform a brake landing as detailed in **4.11.**


#### 4.13 Night Time Operations
4.13.1. The anti-collision strobe should be turned off on the ground and only enabled immediately prior to entering the runway. Staggered taxi is not permitted at night time, instead pilots will maintain 300 feet on the taxi centreline. The taxi light is mandatory during night time taxi except where it might interfere with the vision of an aircraft landing or taking off.

4.13.2. The anti-collision strobe must be turned on before take-off . The exception is during a formation take-off where the flight lead only will set his anti-collision light off and his navigation lights to steady.

4.13.3. During night take-offs all pilots call brake release, take-off, and afterburner termination on the radio.

4.13.4. Except where directed otherwise by departure instructions each aircraft will maintain runway heading to 1000 feet AGL before initiating any turns.



#### 4.14 Radio Procedures
4.14.1. All directives that require a response are to be executed when the last flight member acknowledges the directive. For example with a 2-ship: Lead "Fury 1 tac left"  Wingman "2" and the flight starts the tactical turn. Take note that there is no “action” call. As stated above, the action is initiated immediately after the last wingman responds.

4.14.2. Immediate imperative directives that dont require a response should be repeated three times, and the third repetition is the action call. Each flight member initiates the procedure on the third call, not after. For example for break release: Lead "Brakes, brakes, brakes"

4.14.3. If a wingman is given a directive that they are unable to follow for whatever reason then they should respond with “unable”. Here’s an example where the lead pilot - who has not kicked the flight out to route spacing - calls the flight to fence in: Lead "Fury 1, fence in." Wingman 2, "unable. Padlocked."

#### 4.15 Fuel Requirements

4.15.1. Normal recovery fuel level is 1,500 lbs plus 500 lbs for a missed approach in VFR conditions, or 1000 lbs for a missed approach in IFR conditions meaning that this should be the minimum level at which you may plan to arrive at the final approach fix.

4.15.2. Maximum recovery fuel when landing on a carrier or performing an un-flared landing is 6000 lbs to prevent over-stressing the airframe.

4.15.3. Maximum recovery weight valid for all weather conditions is 30,800 lbs and should be used whenever access to the charts or current weather information is not immediately possible.

4.15.4. Minimum fuel: Will be declared whenever it becomes apparent that an aircraft will enter the approach-pattern with 1,500 lbs or less. At this point you should ensure that ATC understands that your aircraft is now in
a fuel critical state. Note that when flying the standard holding pattern at 220-240 kts for maximum endurance at 15,000 to 20,000 feet fuel flow will be approximately 60 lbs per minute and may approach 70 lbs per minute with a full ordnance load.

4.15.5. Emergency fuel: Declared whenever it becomes apparent that an aircraft will enter the approach-pattern with 1,200 lbs or less, or 600 lbs in either the left or right feeder tanks, whichever occurs first. ATC will be ex- pected to give you priority to land immediately.

4.15.6. Wingman skill levels: Depending on the skill and experience of your wingman, you may need to add 500 lbs to his fuel use estimation to take into account excessing power changes when trying to hold both route and tactical formations.

4.15.7. Afterburner and manoeuvring restrictions: Pilots will not use afterburner when below 1,900 lbs of total fuel or the Bingo fuel value, whichever is higher. The only exception is when its use is required for flight safety. Pilots will not dive steeper than 45° when below 1,900 lbs of total fuel.

4.15.8. Calculating fuel requirements for a route: To calculate the fuel required for a flight:
1. determine the category (from the tables below) best matching your aircraft’s configuration and the airspeed contract;
2. per leg multiply the lbs/nm of the lowest altitude by the distance; 3. sum these values.


4.15.9. Calculating BINGO fuel:
1. calculate the fuel needed to return from the furthest waypoint or geographical point; 2. calculate the fuel needed to divert from your landing airfield to the divert airfield;
3. add 1500lbs reserve fuel;
4. add 500lbs for VFR go-around or 1000lbs for IFR go-around;
5. this sum is your BINGO fuel.

4.15.10. Calculating JOKER fuel: For JOKER add enough fuel to provide sufficient warning that BINGO is approaching. If you are expecting an aerial engagement this may be 1500lbs, or perhaps 500lbs otherwise. The re- maining fuel should provide enough fuel to complete or abort the anticipated action without passing the calculated BINGO fuel level.

### 5 INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES
#### 5.1 General
5.1.1. The HUD is to be used as the primary flight instrument display during both visual and instrument meteo- rological conditions except when the pilot must recover from an unusual attitude. In this situation the ADI should be considered the primary instrument and the HUD used as a cross check.

5.1.2. A HUD failure is considered a degraded performance situation if the HUD can be repeated on one of the DDIs.

5.1.3. A HUD failure is considered an emergency if the HUD cannot be repeated on one of the DDIs.

5.1.4. Takeoff and Join-up: If the cloud ceiling is below 1500 feet and visibility is below 3 miles, each aircraft
element will climb on a takeoff heading to 1000 feet before initiating any turns unless directed otherwise by specific departure instructions. Pilots should maintain a minimum of 20 second spacing and maintain take-off power to 350 KIAS (slower for lead for rejoin according to the contract). From this point each pilot must exercise strict airspeed discipline.

5.1.5. Trail formations: Normal trail formations in IMC are 2 to 3 NM. During trail formations basic instrument flying must be considered the first priority and must not be sacrificed when performing secondary tasks. Airmen must strictly adhere to briefed airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings, and turn points. Pilots experiencing task saturation must cease maintaining radar contact and concentrate solely on flying the instrument procedure, and then notify the flight lead who will in turn notify air traffic control.

5.1.6. No Radar Contact Procedure: The flight lead will call initiating all turns. Subsequent aircraft must de- lay turns to maintain desired spacing. A 20 second or 2 to 3 NM spacing should be maintained using all relevant and available avionics to monitor the current position. Each element will call passing 5000 foot altitude increments during climbs and descents. All altitude and heading changes by any aircraft must be called over the radio. If a visual join-up is not possible at level-off the flight lead will request altitude separation of each succeeding aircraft with a minimum spacing of 500 feet.

5.1.7. Radar Contact Procedures: Each aircraft should call “tied” when they achieve radar contact. No further calls are necessary while contact is maintained except to acknowledge ATC instructions.

5.1.8. Trail Recovery: Trail recoveries are allowed for a maximum of four aircraft at one time and are only per- mitted where IMC procedures are established and where current weather minimums exceed established approach minimums. The flight lead must brief spacing, configuration and airspeeds for all phases of the landing, and must ensure that the appropriate navigation equipment is functioning for all pilots before the flight takes spacing. Pilots must adhere to strict airspeed, altitude and heading values. ATC must provide radar following for the entire flight.

5.1.9. Formation Approach: During IMC conditions pilots will not change lead or wing positions once below 1500 feet AGL unless an aircraft is experiencing and emergency.

### 6 AIR TO AIR COMBAT AND WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT
#### 6.1 General
6.1.1. The lead pilot should call “weapons on simulate” in the fence call when simulated guns or weapons are to be used.

6.1.2. Wingmen should report “weapons on simulate” as part of their fenced-in acknowledgement that they have checked that both master arm is set to SAFE and SIM is boxed when simulated guns or munitions are to be used.

6.1.3. Never employ simulated gun runs with a hot gun.

6.1.4. Never employ a trigger check when the master arm switch is armed.

6.1.5. Minimum airspeed using low altitude offensive or defensive manoeuvring is 300 KIAS to provide a margin
of error against airspeed loss from excessive G manoeuvring.

#### 6.2 The Condensation Layer Check

6.2.1. To ensure that the flight is aware of the current level of the condensation layer the flight lead should en- sure that before entering combat a con-check is performed.

6.2.2. To perform a con-check lead first calls for it. Next the wingman performs a zoom climb until lead sees the vapour trails. Lead now calls “marking, rejoin” and both pilots should note the altitude of the wingman The wingman then reforms in the appropriate formation as briefed or directed by the flight lead.

### 7 AIR-TO-SURFACE WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT
#### 7.1 Training
7.1.1. For simulated A-A engagements pilots will ensure that the master arm switch remains in the safe position and that the SIM option is boxed.

7.1.2. For live ordnance practice pilots will ensure the master arm is returned to safe immediately after complet- ing the escape manoeuvre.

7.1.3. Minimum ceiling in training for climbing or diving deliveries is a cloud ceiling below 2000 feet AGL.

7.1.4. Minimum ceiling in training for level deliveries is a cloud ceiling below 1500 feet AGL.

### 8 ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES
#### 8.1 Ground Operations
8.1.1. If a flight member aborts before takeoff, the flight lead will renumber the flight to maintain numerical sequencing.

8.1.2. If a flight member aborts before takeoff, the flight lead will advise ATC of the change to the flight.

8.1.3. If a pilot aborts a takeoff during the roll, that pilot must say callsign and intensions as soon as practical.

8.1.4. Following aircraft must abort takeoff immediately if adequate clearance from the aborting aircraft can’t be
maintained.

8.1.5. If an abort happens after take-off, the other element member will escort the aborting aircraft to the field intended for emergency landing.

8.1.6. In the case of a bird strike the pilot is expected to abort their takeoff regardless of apparent or reported damage.

#### 8.2 Radio Failure

8.2.1. A pilot who’s radios fail while in close formation will manoeuvre within safe close parameters and then porpoise the nose gently to indicate radio failure. The second pilot should porpoise their nose in response to indicate understanding. Note that a wing rock is dangerous during close formation so should not be briefed as an alternative by the flight lead.

> [[ We need to obtain agreement here of come up with another solution ]] 

8.2.2. After NORDO has been communicated, the pilot with a non-functioning radio will saddle with the other aircraft in close formation and the other aircraft will take lead. Where this happens to a plane in the element flight member in that element with a working radio will notify the lead via the radio of the situation.

8.2.3. Once the element lead has been established that element will navigate back to home plate or the nearest divert airfield and handle all radio communications necessary to bring the other pilot back to final approach, at which point the lead will perform a go-around to allow the damaged plane to land first.
