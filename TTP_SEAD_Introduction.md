# SEAD Introduction

### SEAD neutralizes, destroys or temporarily degrades surface-based enemy air defenses by destruction or disruptive means.

## Categories

SEAD missions is divided into two primary categories.
* Preplanned SEAD
* Reactive SEAD (RSEAD)

**Preplanned SEAD** Targets permanent and semi-permanent target as strategic surface to air missile batterys (SAMs), early warning systems (EW) and ground control intercept (GCI) radar sites, C3 nodes, and passive detection systems. Preplanned SEAD may also target moveable or mobile threat systems.

**Reactive SEAD** suppresses or destroys "pop-up" surface to air threats. RSEAD missions are time sensitive and rely heavily on SOP's and training. Depening on the nature of the supported mission, the threat of enemy air defense assets may require a SEAD effort within minutes or hours. RSEAD typically targets AAA, mobile SAMs and battlefield EW & acqusition radars. Reactive SEAD is further subdivided into three types: immidiate, deliberate and alert RSEAD.
