# SEAD Introduction

### SEAD neutralizes, destroys or temporarily degrades surface-based enemy air defenses by destruction or disruptive means.

## Categories

SEAD missions is divided into two primary categories.
* Preplanned SEAD
* Reactive SEAD (RSEAD)

**Preplanned SEAD** Targets permanent and semi-permanent target as strategic surface to air missile battery's (SAMs), early warning systems (EW) and ground control intercept (GCI) radar sites, C3 nodes, and passive detection systems. Preplanned SEAD may also target movable or mobile threat systems.

**Reactive SEAD** suppresses or destroys "pop-up" surface to air threats. RSEAD missions are time sensitive and rely heavily on SOP's and training. Depending on the nature of the supported mission, the threat of enemy air defense assets may require a SEAD effort within minutes or hours. RSEAD typically targets AAA, mobile SAMs and battlefield EW & acquisition radars. Reactive SEAD is further subdivided into three types: immediate, deliberate and alert RSEAD.
 
### Immediate RSEAD

Immidiate RSEAD occurs when a friendly asset locates an enemy air defense asset and targets them while in the process of conducting another mission. One example is a KA-50 on a AR mission, who locates, identifies and engages a SA-8 during an AR tasking. Immediate RSEAD affords the timeliest response to a "pop-up" enemy air defense asset. If conducted successfully, there is no further need to locate and engage the targeted threat system.

Disadvatages
* The execution of a hasty, unplanned and possibly uncoordinated attack.
* Lack of use of combined arms.
* Possible requirement for attackers to enter or continue operating in enemy SAM WEZ.

### Deliberate RSEAD

Deliberate RSEAD is a coordinated response with assets diverted from other missions against enemy air defense assets located with enough time to organize a response. An example being an A-10 pilot locating an SA-X system while conducting CAS. The A-10 flights contacts their weapon direction and requests SEAD support. The senior director may then order a  deliberate RSEAD mission with available assets. Deliberate RSEAD offers a timely response to a "pop-up" enemy air defense asset. It also allows for a preplanned response / course of action, and utilization of combined arms.

Disadvantages include the possible employment of less then optimum ordnance and the potential requirement for attackers to enter threat engagement envelopes. Deliberate RSEAD is the response when an immediate RSEAD strike is not feasible. (e.g., lack of ordnance, immediate location data unavailable, threat requires a coordinated response)
